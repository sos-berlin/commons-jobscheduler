		The JITL category "FileOperations" includes commonly used operations such as copying,
		renaming, moving and deleting of files. These File Operations are based
		on Java so they are available on all by JobScheduler supported os-platforms . 
		In comparison with functions such as system-specific operating-system commands like
		copy, cp, move, mv, del and rm, which behave
		differently on different operating systems, handling and behavior
		of the File Operations job-classes is identical on all supported operating systems.
</p>
<p>
Most of the job implementations are supporting "regular expressions" on file names for filtering and searching
the files which has to be processed.
</p>
	<p>File operations are often used in job chains that e.g. receive files
		by FTP, rename the files and transfer them to different locations.
